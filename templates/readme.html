		<p>Hello, world.</p>
		<p>
			We are a small brand currently focused on developing accessible open-source
			software and services for creators and artist alike, relying on open standards
			and open communication that everyone can build upon and interact. Our beliefs
			are that no one should be locked in into overpriced subscription plans and social
			media platforms, and we think there's a market of people that believe the
			same as us and will pay for a product that won't rug-pull them as soon as they
			are familiar and created whole careers with it.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you want to know more about our progress, products, and development, feel free
			to read <a href="/" class="underline underline-offset-2">our blog</a>. All software
			created by us is open-source, and available in
			<a href="https://forge.capytal.company" class="underline underline-offset-2">our forge</a>.
			Development is slow, we want to focus on quality over quantity, we don't have any investor
			and probably never will, this is a dream of
			<a href="https://guz.one" class="underline underline-offset-2">someone who's tired of the
				current state of the internet</a> and is trying to make a difference on their free time,
			and it is just the start.
		</p>
		<p>
			For any questions, business inquiries, legal concerns, or just wanting to help, contact
			us via email at
			<a href="mailto:contact@capytal.cc" class="underline underline-offset-2">contact@capytal.cc</a>
