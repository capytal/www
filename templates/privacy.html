				<strong>Our services are developed by people who care about privacy and do not like to have their
					personal and identifiable data tracked by analytics tools without their consent</strong>.
				We try our best to keep our services in line with regulations such as
				<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>,
				<abbr
					title="General Personal Data Protection Law (Portuguese: Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais)">
					LGDP</abbr>, and <abbr title="California Consumer Privacy Act">CCPA</abbr>, while still providing

				<li>Pages that you visit;</li>
				<li>Referrer URL;</li>
				<li>Operating system, browser type and device (User-Agent header);</li>

				<li>Additional metadata about the pages you visit;</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>We do not use cookies to track these informations</strong>, we cannot and do not want to
				be able to associate an user to any of the said data. The data collected by us is mostly used
				to understand things such as what operating system we must prioritize support, what accessibility
				concerns we should take care of more, and what languages we should focus on supporting in our
				services and websites.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>We do not share any of this data to any third-party</strong>, any data provided to us

		</p>
		<p>
			We use a self-hosted and self-managed script and analytics tool

				data by default is anonymised</strong>, accessed in bulk, and cannot be pointed to you
			or any other specific user of our Services, regardless of if you are registered in one of our
			Services or not. We <strong>DO NOT USE Cookies, IP addresses, and technologies like local storage,
				session cookies, IP addresses hashing to collect additional data about you by default</strong>,
			however, we may use said technologies to provide core functionality on our Services, such data
			in most cases is by default not personally-identifiable or used to track you or specific users.

		<h3 id="unique-visitors">How we determine unique visitors</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>We do not use IP addresses or Cookies to determine unique visitors by default.</strong>
			To preserve privacy and not rely or personal identifiers, we use a browser cache-based approach
			to track unique visitors of our Services. If you visit one of our Services websites, your
			browser will cache our tracking script, and reuse it on future visits instead of requesting
			to our services again. This allows us to differentiate between new and returning visitors, and
			does not allows us to identify individual users.
		</p>
		<h2>What information you disclose to us we collect</h2>
		<p>
			Capytal just collects personally-identifiable information when you disclose it to us while
			using our Services, such as when registering an account.
		</p>
		<p>
			We do not collect personally-identifiable and analytical data in a matter that one can be
			associated to another. All analytical data collected automatically as mentioned above, is
			stored in a anonymised form and cannot be associated with a specific user or personally-identifiable
			information.

				secretly;
			</dd>
			<dt class="font-bold mt-5" id="personal-email">

		<h3>What do we use your personal information for?</h3>
		<div class="m-5">
			<h4 class="font-bold">
				Core functionality
			</h4>
			<p>
				Some of our Services require personal information to work properly. In some cases,
				you can substitute personal information for pseudonymous or valid false personal information
				(such as non-working email addresses) if you do not want to disclose personal information.
				Most Services on Capytal require some degree of personal information to provide core functionality.
			</p>
			<h4 class="font-bold mt-5">
				Moderation and detect malicious activity
			</h4>
			<p>
				Your personal information might be collected on automatically-generated log files to detect
				possible malicious activity, to aid in moderation of other users, or to detect bots that
				are improperly programmed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Automatically-generated log files are deleted every 48, though we might choose to keep some
				log files in some cases, such as in the case of an outage or attack on our infrastructure.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h3>What measures we employ to protect you personal information?</h3>
		<p>
			Capytal employs a variety of security measures to protect personal information from being
			breached by malicious actors. These measures include hashing, encryption, containerization
			and other industry-standard measures.
		</p>
		<h3>Do we use cookies and other technologies?</h3>
		<p>
			Yes. Some of our Services may use cookies and similar technologies to store your preferences or
			check if you are logged into an account. These cookies do not store any personally-identifiable
			information in most cases and are not used to get analytical data about you.
		</p>
		<h3>Is information shared to other third-parties?</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>We do not share your personal information with third-parties</strong>. However, some
			Capytal services may be federated, meaning that any messages, chats, public account data
			are shared with any similar servers, such as in case of
			<a href="https://activitypub.rocks" target="_blank"
				rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">ActivityPub</a>-compatible Services (example of these
			services include but is not exhaustive to:
			<a href="https://joinmastodon.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">
				Mastodon</a>,
			<a href="https://pixelfed.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">
				Pixelfed</a>, and
			<a href="https://join-lemmy.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">
				Lemmy</a>)
		</p>
		<p>
			Some information and data, such as username, posts, and user-generated content may be shared
			publicly by you while using our Services. This include cases such as, for example, creating a
			public bug report on our Forge Service. It is up to you to not share personally-identifiable
			information on these public channels, we do not take responsibility on personally-identifiable
			information being shared by you accidentally or not on these public Services.
		</p>
		<h4>Legal Action exception</h4>
		<p>
			<strong>Your personally-identifiable data may be requested by legal authorities</strong>
			and used for legal and regulatory responsibilities if necessary, in such cases we may try
			to preserve and fight for your privacy if we think the reason isn't justifiable, but we
			cannot prevent authorities to access your information if preventing it results in legal
			and financial issues for us.
		</p>
		<h4>Embedded and referenced content</h4>
		<p>
			<strong>Embedded content from other providers may be available in our Service, these providers may track
				your interaction with their and our content</strong>. For example, if you click in an embedded video
			from YouTube, <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">
				Google</a> will track you interaction.
		</p>
		<p>
			Similarly, content and other third-parties services may be referenced via hyperlinks, accessing
			third-parties content may end with your data being shared with a third-party which we cannot
			have control over on how and what data is handled and processed.
		</p>
		<p>
			You are recommended to review third-party's Privacy Policies before interacting with them.
		</p>
		<h3>Data retention policy</h3>
		<p>
			Automatically-generated log files or server logs are deleted every 48 hours, but may be kept
			for longer to investigate malicious behaviour as outline above.
		</p>
		<p>
			Information that you provide to us might be store indefinitely or as long as Capytal and our
			Services survives, unless you personally delete it yourself or request us to delete it.
